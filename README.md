# Kickstarting Campaign Challenge

## Overview of Project
The Kickstarter Campaign is about Louise's play Fever, which came close to achieving its fund-raising goal. The campaign lasted 28 days before the fundraising deadline. Given the result of the campaign, Louise wants to compare other similar campaign in order to understand why certain campaigns were successful and others were not, and to gain insight about future campaign / initiatives.
### Purpose
The purpose of this kickstarter analysis is help Louise gain an understanding of similar campaigns across the globe and to see campaign goals and how it impacted these campaigns success and other factors which contribute to a successful campaign. 
## Analysis and Challenges
The challenges include sifting through campaign data across multiple the globe in multiple category and undertanding campaign goals, launch dates and campaign duration, success of the campaign and the backers of the campaign. There are many ways to view the kickstarter data, but analysis must provide meaningful insights such as, pledged vs. goals ratio, duration of the campaign, which country ran highest rate of campaign success, number of backers and average donations of the campaign, most effective category for campaign success. Ultimately, these analysis were important in order to help Louise understand how to run successful furture campaign, which category to focus future campaign on, depending on the country, and getting the right audience / backers in order to meet campaign goals.
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
Outcomes based on launch date was specifically looking at the theatre category across multiple countries and years, and seeing the outcome - successful, failed, cancelled in relation to the total campaign in any given month. This is essentially looking at the best timing, by month, in any given year to run a theatre category. The analysis showed that successful campaigns peaked in May. June and July were also relatively strong in terms of successful campaigns. Also, December happen to have roughly the same numbers of failed and successful campaign in the theatre category. The reason could be that December is an holiday month and people are less generous backing a campaign. This trend flowed into January.
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
Outcome based on goals look at the campaign goals and compare to the amount pledged in order to gauge the overall success of a particular campaign. The analysis performed is simply taking the pledged amount divided by the goals amount to calculate the ratio. If the amount is more than a factor of 1 or 100%, it meant that the particular campaign met its goal and was successful. For example the British musical UCAS had a $1,500 goal and a $2,000 pledged amount. The factor was 1.33 or 133%. This meant UCAS was a successful musical campaign and it exceeded its goal. In other instance, such as the U.S. drama Letters to Daniel, a $10,000 campaign goal only raised $325 pledged amount. This came well below the campaign goal at a factor of 0.03 or 3%. It can be concluded that the campaign goal was not met and that could have been because of several factors. 
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
Challenges include what the best analysis to use to help Louise understand campaign trend and form a solid conclusion of what makes a successful campaign. Multiple factors drive a campaign success, including launch date, category and country, number of backers, etc. The challenge include whether the kickstarter data is sufficient and will allow us to make a solid conclusion. Some of the difficulties included the interpretation of a particular outcome.
## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
May is the best month to run a successful campaign as it has the highest number of successful campaigns of all the months in any given year. The other conclusion is that December is the least desirable month to run a campaign as the likelihood of a failed campaign is higher in relation to the other months

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
Overall, for successful campaigns the ratio of goals to pledged amount is 1:2, which means amounts pledged is at most twice the goal amount. For failed campaigns, the goal to pledged amount is about 33x, which means the goal amounts is 33 times the pledged amount. Conclusion can be drawn that failed campaigns had lofty expectations and the goals were clearly unreasonable. Though more data may be necessary to see other drivers of a failed campaign
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
Despite the data show campaigns by different countries, it lacks location specific details such as city, demographics, median income of backers, backers preference, campaign marketing channels such as email, TV advertisement, etc.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
Looking at outcome based on parent category / subcategory, outcome based on campaign duration.
